# Demo-App to visualize Directed Acyclic Graphs

This project is a demo that I built to learn/experiment with a few technologies.
It uses

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap a react app
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) as the Frontend Framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for typed Javascript code
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for some unit tests
- [Cytoscape.JS](https://js.cytoscape.org/) to visualize the DAG
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the little bit of styling there is

If you find parts of it useful, that's great! The code is release under the Unlicense which means you can take whatever you want from it without giving credit etc.

## Caveats

I'm new to Typescript, React and most of the other tools. Don't expect this code to adhere to best practices :-)
